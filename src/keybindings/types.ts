// Keybinding system — shared types.

// dispatcher (useKeybindings), the Ctrl+K command palette (shortcut hints +
// searchable actions), and the Keybindings settings tab (recorder UI). Keeping
// a single source of truth means the palette and the settings tab can never
// drift out of sync.

 *  idea: the same combo can mean different things depending on focus + app
 *  state. Only `global` and `player` are dispatched by the engine today; the
 *  rest are documentation-only contexts whose keys are owned by their own
 *  components (chat input, MultiChat tabs, modals). */
